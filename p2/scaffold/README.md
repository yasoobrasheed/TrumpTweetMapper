# P2 - Scaffold
In the folder you find a scaffold where you can do your p2 work. By default it
is configured to use react (which we highly encourage you to use), but it can easily
be modified to use framework-less javascript.

## Getting Started

As always we begin by installing the required dependencies

```sh
npm install

npm run start

# or if yarning

yarn

yarn start
```

The default configuration opens a port on http://localhost:3001/, so simply
point a browser to that address and you'll be up and running.

## What to do?

In this project we are giving you more freedom than with previous assignments. You are
free to install whatever libraries you want (with the exclusion of coffeescript
  or other non js langauges). If you aren't using a package you should uninstall it.

Unlike previous distributions we have disabled scss, because it was adding a lot
of time to the builds and broke the build for some users. You should feel free to
add styles but keep them constrained to main.css. Nb styles are not autorefreshed,
so if you change the style you will need to reload the page.

If you have any scripts that you used to modify your data please check them into the scripts
folder. If not don't worry! Just make sure to include what you did in your write up.
